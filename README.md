<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Pick me ups is a mental health application aimed with the goal of providing inspirational quotes to users depending on their moods.
Answers to prompts given to the user will be filtered accordingly through the use of sentiment analysis and return a suitable quote.
The user can also go ahead and generate a random quote from a source of many well known historical figures.

This project was built using ParallelDot's Emotion Analysis API to categorize and filter quotes.
User responses are also filtered and assigned a category of quotes that complement the responeses based on the emotion type.
